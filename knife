Update your node’s configuration
The command knife ssh enables you to update your node’s configuration when your cookbook changes. To update your node using password 
authentication with attributes

knife ssh 'name:nodename' 'sudo chef-client' --ssh-user USER --ssh-password 'PASSWORD' --attribute ipaddress
Delete Node data
Chef makes a distinction between the nodes that are being managed and the clients that are authorized to make API calls to the Chef 
server. Delete Node data by running:

knife node delete nodename --yes
knife client delete nodename --yes
The knife node delete removes the node’s metadata from the Chef server and knife client delete  deletes the entry (including the public
part of the RSA key pair) from the Chef server’s API client list.

Delete Chef Cookbook/roles and RSA private key
To delete your cookbook from the Chef server

knife cookbook delete cookbookname --all --yes
If you omit the --all argument, you’ll be prompted to select which version to delete

To delete the role from the Chef server

$ knife role delete myrole --yes
Delete the RSA private key from your node

During the bootstrap process, an RSA private key is generated on your node to enable your node to make API calls to the Chef server.
This key is saved to /etc/chef/client.pem on Linux systems

If you plan to bootstrap your node a second time, for example, to practice the process, you’ll need to log in to your node and delete 
the RSA private key file, like this

$ sudo rm /etc/chef/client.pem
